# TransactionService

Technology stack
I'd prefer to implement using spring. But due to given condition no spring. The chosen technologies:

Java 8
Jetty + Jersey
Jackson
Maven

Project building
mvn package
mvn install

Project running
java -jar revolut-txmgr.jar

TODO
Unit test 
Many improvements can be done

Conclusion
If I get an opportunity to build this system for real world, I will prefer to analyze micro services, container(docker) and kubernetes based approach with bare metal hardware in-premise.
Alternatively I will also like to analyze deployment in private cloud(openstack).
